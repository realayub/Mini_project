# Image Denoising

## Description

This project explores the development and implementation of image denoising techniques. Image denoising is crucial for enhancing visual quality by removing noise, which can compromise the clarity and detail of digital images. Our project focuses on the Non-Local Means algorithm, a powerful method that utilizes similar patches throughout the image to effectively suppress noise while preserving important structures.

## Features

- **Implementation of Traditional Filters**: Mean Filter, Median Filter, Gaussian Filter
- **Non-Local Means Algorithm**: Advanced denoising technique leveraging similar patches in the image
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluation against traditional local smoothing filters

## Motivation

The presence of noise can significantly degrade the quality of digital images, affecting various fields such as photography, medical imaging, and satellite imagery. This project aims to enhance image quality and aid in accurate analysis by developing effective denoising techniques.

## Objectives

- **Explore Existing Algorithms**: Study traditional and advanced denoising algorithms
- **Develop Innovative Solutions**: Create new methods for effective noise reduction
- **Comparative Evaluation**: Analyze and compare the performance of different denoising techniques
